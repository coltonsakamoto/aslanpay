# 🚀 **AgentPay Developer Onboarding Priority**

## 🎯 **CORE MISSION: Make AgentPay the default payment choice for AI agents**

### **SUCCESS METRIC**: 100 developers integrate AgentPay Control Tower in 30 days

---

## **🔥 TOP PRIORITIES (CRITICAL FOR ADOPTION)**

### **1. 2-Minute Integration Experience** ⚡
**Goal**: Developer can make their first AI agent purchase in under 2 minutes

**What we need:**
```bash
# This should work instantly:
npm install agentpay
export AGENTPAY_TOKEN=your_token
node examples/first-purchase.js
# → "✅ AI agent just bought $10 gift card!"
```

**Status**: ✅ Working (test with `test-openai-integration.js`)

### **2. Copy-Paste OpenAI Integration** 📋
**Goal**: One code block that enables ChatGPT to make purchases

**What we need:**
```javascript
// Copy-paste this into any OpenAI app:
const agentpay = require('agentpay');
const functions = agentpay.getFunctionSchema();
// Add to your OpenAI completion call
```

**Status**: ✅ Working (see `agentpay-sdk.js`)

### **3. Live Demo That Wows** 🎪
**Goal**: Developers see AgentPay working with real AI agents immediately

**What we need:**
- Live website: agentpay.com/demo
- ChatGPT making real purchases
- "Try it yourself" button

**Status**: ⚠️ NEEDS WORK - we have local demos but no public site

## **📊 DEVELOPER ADOPTION BLOCKERS TO REMOVE**

### **❌ Blocker 1: Complex Setup**
**Problem**: Too many environment variables, complex configuration
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - `SECURE-SETUP-GUIDE.md` simplifies this

### **❌ Blocker 2: No Public Demo**
**Problem**: Developers can't see it working without setup
**Solution**: 🔴 CRITICAL - Deploy demo to agentpay.com

### **❌ Blocker 3: Framework Confusion**
**Problem**: "Which AI framework does this work with?"
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - Universal `/v1/authorize` → `/confirm` flow

### **❌ Blocker 4: Trust/Security Concerns**
**Problem**: "Is this secure enough for my users' money?"
**Solution**: ✅ FIXED - Enterprise security audit passed
