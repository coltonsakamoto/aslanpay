# 🚀 AgentPay Launch Strategy: No Permission Required

## 🎯 **Phase 1: Launch Independently (Month 1-3)**

### **Step 1: Function Calling Integration**
```javascript
// ✅ LAUNCH DAY: ChatGPT can call AgentPay functions
const agentPayFunctions = [
  {
    name: "agentpay_purchase",
    description: "Make autonomous purchases with spending limits",
    parameters: {
      type: "object",
      properties: {
        service: { type: "string", enum: ["domain", "flight", "ecommerce"] },
        params: { type: "object" },
        maxAmount: { type: "number" }
      }
    }
  }
];

// Developers integrate this into their ChatGPT apps immediately
```

### **Step 2: Custom GPT Launch**
- **"AgentPay Commerce Assistant"** in GPT Store
