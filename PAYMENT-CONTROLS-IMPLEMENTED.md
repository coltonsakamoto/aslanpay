# 🛡️ AgentPay Payment Controls & Server Fixes

## 🔧 Server Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Missing Prisma Models
**Problem**: TypeScript compilation errors due to missing `idempotencyRecord` and `webhookLog` models
**Solution**: 
- Added `IdempotencyRecord` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`
- Added `WebhookLog` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`  
- Generated Prisma client with `npx prisma generate`
- Pushed schema changes with `npx prisma db push`

### ✅ 2. Environment Variables
**Problem**: Missing `DATABASE_URL` and other required environment variables
**Solution**:
- Set `DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"` for SQLite development
- Set test Stripe keys for local development
- Server now compiles and runs without TypeScript errors

## 🛡️ Payment Controls Implemented

### 🎯 Demo-Level Controls
- **Maximum Demo Spending**: $100 total limit
- **Transaction Limit**: 10 transactions maximum per demo session
- **Daily Reset**: Limits reset each day automatically
- **Persistent Storage**: Uses localStorage to track spending across sessions

### 💰 Amount Validation
```javascript
transactionLimits: {
  'gift-card': { min: 5, max: 50 },
  'domain': { min: 10, max: 25 },
  'sms': { min: 0.01, max: 1 },
